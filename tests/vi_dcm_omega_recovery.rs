//! Does VI recover the **between-subject** variance `Ω` on a deep compartment model?
//!
//!   cargo test --release --features nn,slow-tests --test vi_dcm_omega_recovery
//!
//! ## Why this file exists
//!
//! `VI_PLAN.md` §6 item 13 asked for a simulated-DCM recovery test and it never landed.
//! The gap was specific and consequential: **every** `Ω` assertion VI carries is blind to
//! a downward bias in `Ω_bsv` by construction.
//!
//! - The exact-case oracle (`vi/elbo_oracle.rs`) fits a linear-Gaussian model, where
//!   full-rank VI is *exact*. Collapse arises from `q` underfitting a non-Gaussian
//!   posterior, which the oracle removes by design.
//! - `closed_form_omega_matches_the_exact_posterior_moments`,
//!   `closed_form_omega_is_a_stationary_point_of_the_kl` and
//!   `closed_form_omega_zeroes_the_omega_gradient` all check that
//!   `Ω* = (1/N)Σ(Sᵢ+μᵢμᵢᵀ)` is the right maximizer *given* the `φᵢ`. Collapse is a bias
//!   **in** the `φᵢ`, so a correct maximizer reports it faithfully.
//! - `both_omega_update_routes_agree_approximately` compares the two `Ω` routes at a
//!   relative tolerance of `1.0` — a 2× disagreement passes.
//! - `tests/vi_time_varying_iov.rs` bands `Ω_iov` but simulated `Ω_bsv` and never looked
//!   at it. (Fixed in the same change as this file.)
//!
//! ## What went wrong on real data, and what it taught this file
//!
//! A busulfan-shaped DCM fit (60 subjects, `[covariate_nn]` over `WT` and `CRCL`,
//! `layers = [6, 6]` ⇒ 74 weights, IOV on CL) returned `ω²(CL) = 0.0173` against a
//! simulated truth of `0.09` — **5× low** — while reporting `converged: true`,
//! `elbo_tightness_ratio: 0.544` and `n_fd_subjects: 0`. Every health check
//! `docs/estimation/vi.qmd` tells a user to read came back green.
//!
//! A capacity sweep on that exact dataset (same seed, same options, only `layers`
//! changing) isolated the cause:
//!
//! | `layers` | NN weights | ω²(CL) | −2 log L |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `[2]` | 12 | 0.1323 | 1151.3 |
//! | `[3]` | 17 | 0.1318 | 1147.6 |
//! | `[6, 6]` | 74 | **0.0173** | 1061.0 |
//!
//! The dataset has 60 subjects and **60 distinct `(WT, CRCL)` pairs**. A 74-weight
//! network over two subject-unique continuous covariates can index subjects, so
//! between-subject clearance is explainable as a covariate effect and `Ω` has nothing
//! left to hold. VI's Adam finds that optimum (87 OFV points better than FOCEI); FOCEI's
//! outer loop does not reach it, which is why FOCEI looked correct there by accident.
//!
//! ## The two mechanisms, and why the design decides which one you get
//!
//! 1. **Variational variance understatement.** `q` is a Gaussian approximation to a
//!    non-Gaussian posterior and understates its spread; `Ω*` averages `S + μμᵀ`, so the
//!    understatement passes through. Documented (`docs/estimation/vi.qmd`, VI_PLAN §4.4,
//!    §10.6), expected, and mild — it averages over `N` subjects.
//! 2. **The network absorbing between-subject variation.** A flexible fixed-effects model
//!    can explain with `θ` what belongs to `η`. This one is *not* mild, is not specific to
//!    VI, and scales with network capacity rather than washing out with `N`.
//!
//! (2) is what `NN_REGULARIZATION_PLAN.md` exists to address and what the paper's
//! Discussion asks for. Crucially, **(2) requires a design that lets the network separate
//! subjects**, and getting that design right took two attempts:
//!
//! - **Tied covariate levels** (12 levels × 5 subjects). `ω²(CL)` *rose* toward truth as
//!   capacity grew — `0.1207` at `[4]` → `0.0921` at `[8,8]`, truth `0.09` — the opposite
//!   sign from busulfan, because with ties the network cannot index subjects however wide
//!   it is. Kept, as [`capacity_alone_does_not_collapse_iiv_when_the_design_identifies_omega`].
//! - **One subject-unique covariate** (60 distinct `WT`). Still no collapse: `0.1256` at
//!   `[4]` → `0.1074` at `[8,8]`. 60 distinct values on a single axis ask a `tanh` net for
//!   a wiggly interpolant over an ordered domain, and its smoothness bias makes that a hard
//!   optimum for Adam to find.
//! - **Two subject-unique covariates**, scattered independently — busulfan's actual
//!   configuration. This is what the fixture uses now.
//!
//! So capacity is not the variable, and neither is subject-uniqueness on its own;
//! **capacity relative to the number of distinct covariate patterns, in a space where those
//! patterns are actually separable**, is. This file tests both designs and asserts the
//! contrast.
//!
//! ## Validation strategy
//!
//! A round-trip against ferx's own `simulate()`, not NONMEM — the same rationale as
//! `tests/vi_time_varying_iov.rs`. The question is whether the estimator recovers a known
//! `Ω`, and only a simulation knows the true `Ω`. A NONMEM comparison would establish that
//! two tools agree on an estimate, not that the estimate is right, and NONMEM has no DCM
//! to compare against in the first place.
//!
//! **The truth is an explicit analytic covariate model, and the fitted model is the DCM.**
//! That asymmetry is the point. Simulating from a DCM and fitting the same DCM would start
//! the network at (or near) the weights that generated the data, so the fit would never
//! have to learn anything and the absorption mechanism in (2) could not appear. Here the
//! network starts flat, at its declared `init`, and has to discover the `WT` relationship
//! — which is the situation a real DCM fit is in, and the situation in which it can
//! over-explain. `Ω`, `σ` and the covariate relationship are all known exactly either way,
//! which is all the assertions need. NN *weights* are never asserted: they are
//! non-identifiable under permutation symmetry (see `tests/nn_fit_convergence.rs`).
