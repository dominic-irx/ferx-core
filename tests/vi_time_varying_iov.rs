//! Time-varying clearance combined with inter-occasion variability, fitted by VI.
//!
//! Gate the slow ones so they are skipped in the default PR job:
//!
//!   cargo test --features slow-tests --test vi_time_varying_iov
//!
//! ## Why this pairing gets its own file
//!
//! A declining clearance and a per-occasion random effect are *confusable by
//! construction*. Both make a subject's clearance differ between early and late records.
//! Given only the data, the split between "CL is falling over the course" and "CL is
//! redrawn each occasion" is identified solely by the shape of the difference —
//! systematic and monotone versus exchangeable across occasions. A fit that gets the
//! split wrong still converges, still reports plausible parameters, and is wrong in the
//! way that matters clinically: extrapolating a decline that isn't there, or attributing
//! a real decline to noise.
//!
//! This is the busulfan shape — a multi-day course whose clearance falls day over day
//! while each day carries its own variability — and it is the case where "IOV works" and
//! "time-varying covariates work" being separately true does not imply the pair works.
//!
//! ## Validation strategy
//!
//! A round-trip against ferx's own `simulate()`, not against NONMEM. That is deliberate
//! and it is the *stronger* anchor for this particular claim: the question is whether the
//! estimator recovers a known decomposition into `KDEC` and `Ω_iov`, and only a
//! simulation knows the true split. A NONMEM comparison would tell us the two tools agree
//! on an estimate, not that the estimate is right. (The NONMEM anchor for VI's parameters
//! generally lives in `docs/estimation/vi.qmd`; the IOV objective itself is anchored in
//! `tests/warfarin_iov_nonmem.rs`.)
//!
//! Three claims, in increasing order of what they'd catch:
//!
//! 1. VI recovers `KDEC` and `Ω_iov` simultaneously from data containing both.
//! 2. Dropping IOV from the model biases the recovered decline — the confusion is real,
//!    so a test that only ever fits the correct model would not notice the estimator
//!    leaning on the wrong term.
//! 3. Dropping the decline costs objective function on 1 df — the decline is genuinely
//!    identified, not absorbed by the per-occasion effect.
