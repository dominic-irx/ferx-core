//! **The bound property**: `−2·ELBO ≥ −2 log p(y)`, checked against adaptive
//! Gauss–Hermite quadrature (`VI_VALIDATION.md` Anchor A).
//!
//! # What this establishes that nothing else does
//!
//! `elbo_oracle.rs` anchors the ELBO on a model where `q` can represent the posterior
//! *exactly*, so the bound gap is zero by construction. That is a sharp check on the
//! objective's algebra, and it is blind to everything that only happens when `q`
//! **cannot** match the posterior — which is every real model, and is where
//! `elbo_tightness_ratio` and the `Ω`-collapse behaviour live.
//!
//! This module closes that gap. On a genuinely nonlinear model the marginal has no
//! closed form, so the truth comes from adaptive GH quadrature
//! ([`crate::estimation::agq`]) instead. The anchoring chain is
//!
//! ```text
//!   NONMEM LAPLACIAN  →  AGQ  →  the ELBO bound
//! ```
//!
//! AGQ reproduces NONMEM's `LAPLACIAN` to six significant figures (see
//! [`crate::types::EstimationMethod::Laplace`]), and
//! `oracle_tests::agq_marginal_matches_the_exact_linear_gaussian_marginal` pins it to a
//! *closed form* in the same additive-constant convention the ELBO uses. So the
//! quadrature is not another estimate to be argued with — it is a transferred anchor.
//!
//! # Why a violation cannot be explained away
//!
//! Every estimate-to-estimate comparison in this space has an escape hatch: FOCEI, SAEM
//! and VI target the same parameters by different approximations, so a disagreement is
//! always arguably bias rather than a bug. An ELBO exceeding the marginal it bounds has
//! no such defence. It is a theorem, and the failures it catches are exactly the ones
//! finite-difference parity cannot see, because FD parity holds just as well for a
//! consistently wrong objective: a mis-scaled KL, a prior counted twice, a dropped
//! entropy term, a wrong Jacobian in the reparameterization.
//!
//! # What it does *not* isolate
//!
//! Both sides evaluate the same conditional likelihood — VI's data term and AGQ's
//! integrand are both `obs_nll_subject_into` underneath. So this does not re-validate
//! the likelihood; it validates the **marginalization** built on top of it. The
//! likelihood itself is anchored by the NONMEM comparisons elsewhere in the repo, which
//! is precisely why the chain above starts there.
//!
//! More importantly, **the bound is one-sided**, and that shapes what the tests here can
//! and cannot see. An objective that is too *small* violates `ELBO ≤ log p(y)` and is
//! caught; an objective that is too *large* satisfies it more comfortably and is not. So
//! the bound alone is not a complete check on the ELBO, and the module pairs it with
//! [`monte_carlo_elbo_matches_the_quadrature_elbo`], which is two-sided.
//!
//! Measured, by mutation:
//!
//! | Mutation | bound | bridge | KL |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `neg_elbo = data − kl` (KL sign flipped) | **fails** | **fails** | passes |
//! | `neg_elbo = data + 0.5·kl` (KL halved) | **fails** | **fails** | passes |
//! | `neg_elbo = 0.98·data + kl` (too optimistic) | **fails** | **fails** | passes |
//! | `neg_elbo = 1.02·data + kl` (too pessimistic) | passes | **fails** | passes |
//! | `tr(Ω⁻¹S)` → diagonal only (a no-op in 1-D) | passes | passes | **fails** |
//!
//! where *bound* is [`production_elbo_never_exceeds_the_agq_marginal`], *bridge* is
//! [`monte_carlo_elbo_matches_the_quadrature_elbo`], and *KL* is
//! [`production_kl_matches_the_textbook_kl`].
//!
//! The last row is why that third test exists, and it is the most instructive one here. A
//! diagonal-only trace is exactly correct when `n_eta = 1` and silently discards posterior
//! correlation in 2-D, and **neither the bound nor the bridge could see it** — the dropped
//! term is only `0.003`–`0.012` on the `−2` scale against a `4·SEM` band of `0.047`–`0.099`.
//! Both sides of that comparison have a closed form, so comparing them through a
//! Monte-Carlo ELBO was discarding two orders of magnitude of precision for nothing. When
//! both sides have a closed form, compare the closed forms.
//!
//! Note also that [`elbo_never_exceeds_the_agq_marginal`] survives *every* row: it
//! evaluates the ELBO through this module's own quadrature and its own
//! [`kl_to_prior_1d`], so it tests the inequality as mathematics and says nothing about
//! production. [`production_elbo_never_exceeds_the_agq_marginal`] is the one that makes
//! the claim about the number `FitResult::vi::neg_two_elbo` reports. Both are kept: the
//! first localizes a failure to the theory or to AGQ, the second to the implementation.
//!
//! # Why the bound is testable without a converged fit
//!
//! `ELBO(q) ≤ log p(y)` holds for **every** `q`, not just the optimum — the gap is
//! `KL(q ‖ p(η|y)) ≥ 0`. So the strongest fast test is not one converged point but many
//! deliberately-wrong `q`s: displaced means, inflated and collapsed variances, `q` at the
//! prior. Each must satisfy the bound, and the gap must grow as `q` is moved away from
//! the posterior. A converged VI fit is checked too, under `slow-tests`, but it is the
//! weaker of the two tests because it probes one point.
//!
//! # Two fixtures
//!
//! `n_eta = 1` — lognormal `η` on `CL` — is the fixture that makes every quantity here
//! auditable by hand. `n_eta = 2` — lognormal `η` on both `CL` and `V` under a
//! `block_omega` with correlation `0.3` — is the one that actually exercises the code
//! paths a scalar fixture cannot reach: the full-rank Cholesky `φ` layout, the
//! multivariate KL, and a posterior whose *shape* (not just width) `q` has to match.
//!
//! The `q` sweep in two dimensions displaces the mean along four directions in whitened
//! posterior space — each axis, and both diagonals — because a bug in the off-diagonal of
//! `L` is invisible to a displacement along an axis. AGQ costs `n_nodes^n_eta`, so the 2-D
//! fixture uses fewer nodes per dimension; the tolerances are unchanged.
//!
//! # The fixtures are lognormal on purpose
//!
//! `CL = TVCL·exp(η)` stays positive for every `η`, so a wide quadrature grid never
//! leaves the model's domain. The additive `CL = TVCL + η` construction that makes
//! `elbo_oracle.rs` exact would drive `CL` negative in the tails — that is the documented
//! reason its own calibration test stops at five nodes, and it would put a floor on the
//! accuracy reachable here. Lognormality also makes the true posterior genuinely skewed,
//! so a Gaussian `q` *cannot* be exact and the gap under test is real rather than
//! numerical noise.
//!
//! # The error model has to be additive, and that is not a detail
//!
//! Quadrature over `q` evaluates `−log p(y|η)` at nodes several `σ_q` out, which for a
//! lognormal `η` on a rate constant means predictions ranging over many orders of
//! magnitude. Under **proportional** error the residual variance `(f·σ)²` collapses with
//! the prediction, so the `res²/(f·σ)²` term explodes as `f → 0`: measured on this
//! fixture, the data term runs `5.2` at `η = 0` to `9.5e11` at `η = +3`, flattening at
//! `8.4e13` once the variance floor clamps it. `E_q` is then dominated entirely by tail
//! nodes whose weights are `~1e−30` but whose integrand is `~1e13`, and the quadrature
//! ELBO becomes meaningless (it came out at `1e11`).
//!
//! Under **additive** error the same sweep stays bounded — `11.5` at `η = 0`, `331` at
//! the extremes — because `(y − f)²/σ²` is bounded whenever `f` is. That boundedness is
//! what makes an expectation over a full-support Gaussian `q` well behaved, so the
//! fixture uses additive error.
//!
//! This is a property of the objective, not of this test: the ELBO's data term genuinely
//! is tail-dominated for a proportional error model whose prediction can approach zero.
//! VI's Monte-Carlo estimator does not notice, because with `vi_mc_samples = 8` it never
//! draws a `4σ` tail — which is worth knowing as a variance hazard, and is a separate
//! question from the bound.

/// silently ignores posterior correlation — passed every other test in this module. Measured
/// on the 2-D fixture, the dropped term `2·Ω⁻¹₀₁·S₀₁` is only `0.003`–`0.012` on the `−2`
/// scale, because the posterior there is genuinely correlated (`−0.30` to `−0.42`) but tight
/// (`S₀₀ ≈ 0.014`). The MC bridge test's `4·SEM` band is `0.047`–`0.099`, so it cannot
/// resolve it, and the bound test cannot either: a too-small KL makes `−2·ELBO` *smaller* by
/// `0.007`, nowhere near enough to cross a gap of that size.
///
/// A `1e-12` deterministic comparison catches it immediately. The lesson generalizes — when
/// both sides of a check have a closed form, compare the closed forms.
///
/// # The cases
///
/// `S` is not merely a scaled Laplace covariance here, because the whole point is to reach
/// off-diagonals that a near-diagonal posterior never produces: the 2-D cases include
/// correlations of both signs up to `±0.8`, against a prior `Ω` that is itself correlated.
/// [`MeanField`] is included too — its diagonal-only trace is *correct* for a diagonal `S`,
/// since `Ω⁻¹ₖⱼSⱼₖ` vanishes off the diagonal, so the same textbook formula must reproduce it.
