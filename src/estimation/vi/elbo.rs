//! ELBO value and gradient assembly.
//!
//! Implements the analytic-KL form described in [`super`]:
//!
//! ```text
//! −ELBO = Σᵢ [ E_{η∼qᵢ}( −log p(yᵢ | η, θ, Σ) )  +  KL( qᵢ ‖ N(0, Ω) ) ]
//!              └──── Monte Carlo, `n_mc_samples` draws ────┘  └─ closed form ─┘
//! ```
//!
//! Under `vi_kl = mc` the second term is estimated from the same draws instead, as
//! `E_q[log q(η) − log p(η|Ω)]` — see [`mc_kl_draw`], and note that its `φ` gradient
//! is then a path derivative rather than the derivative of the reported value.
//!
//! Everything here works with **`−ELBO`**, so the quantity is a thing to
//! *minimize*, consistent with every other objective in the crate, and can be
//! handed straight to [`super::adam::AdamState::step`].
//!
//! # The additive constant
//!
//! The data term is [`obs_nll_subject_grad`]'s NLL, which — like `individual_nll`,
//! FOCE's objective, and NONMEM's OFV — omits the `½·n_obs·log 2π` constant. The
//! KL term is exact. So `2·(−ELBO)` is on the same footing as the OFVs reported
//! elsewhere in `ferx-core`: comparable *between VI fits of the same data*, and
//! not a `−2 log L`. See the plan's §4.3 and `vi_final_ofv` for getting a real one.
//!
//! # Common random numbers
//!
//! `ε` is drawn from a seed derived deterministically from
//! `(seed, iteration, subject, sample)` — never from a shared mutable RNG. Two
//! consequences, both wanted: the fit is reproducible regardless of thread
//! scheduling, and at a *fixed* iteration index `−ELBO` is a deterministic
//! function of `(x, φ)`, which is what makes the finite-difference parity tests
//! exact rather than noisy.

/// `converged: true` — 973 OFV worse than the same model started sensibly, with
