///
/// Two rules, both 1-based like NONMEM's `CMT`:
///   - **Range — every dose, whatever its amount.** `cmt` must not exceed the
///     model's state count. This is deliberately *not* skipped for `AMT=0`:
///     both walks bound-check the compartment before the amount is read, so an
///     inert row with an out-of-range `CMT` panics exactly like a real dose.
///     `CMT=0` is left alone — every path treats it as NONMEM's "default dose
///     compartment" (the walk via `saturating_sub(1)`, `dose_needs_event_walk`
///     by mapping it to 1, the superposition path by ignoring `cmt`), so it is
///     consistent, not a silent mis-route.
///   - **Routing — infusions that actually deliver.** The compartment must be
///     in [`PkModel::infusable_compartments`] — central for every model, the
///     oral depot since #400, the peripheral(s) of the 2-/3-cpt IV models, and
///     — since #375 — the oral models' peripheral(s) too (the oral propagators
///     reuse the IV forced response; nothing flows back into the depot). That
///     makes the set `1..=n_states` for all six walk-supported models, so with
///     the range rule claimed first the only value this rule can still reject
///     is `CMT=0`, which has no meaning for a zero-order input. A zero-amount
///     infusion is exempt (`duration = AMT/RATE = 0`, so no path opens a rate
///     window). Checked only for the six event-walk models: `dose_channel` *is*
///     the walk's routing table, and a transit/IG subject never takes that walk
///     — an infusion reroutes it to the model's ODE twin
///     (`CompiledModel::effective_for`, #719 gap 2), which addresses
///     compartments directly. Applying this table to them would reject a
///     supported model.
///
/// **ODE models take the range rule but not the routing rule** (#899).
/// `ode/predictions.rs` indexes the state vector directly, so every compartment
/// the `[odes]` block declares is addressable and the `infusable_compartments`
/// table has no ODE analogue — but "declares" is the operative word. A `CMT`
/// past the end of the declared state vector used to fall through that engine's
/// `if cmt_idx < n { … }` guards and be **silently dropped**: the fit converged,
/// reported a finite OFV, and quietly ignored the dose. So the range rule runs
/// for both engines, reading `OdeSpec::n_states` instead of a `PkModel`
/// topology, and names the declared `state_names` in the message. `CMT=0`
/// splits the same way on both engines: accepted for a **bolus** (it is the
