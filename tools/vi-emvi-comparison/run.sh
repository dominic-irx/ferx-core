# was never installed, that path does not exist and *every* rxode2 model fails at the LINK
# step -- the C compile succeeds, which makes it look like a code problem. Emptying FLIBS
# works because macOS links with -undefined dynamic_lookup, so the Fortran symbols reached
# through -lRblas/-lRlapack resolve from R's own bundled libraries at load time.
